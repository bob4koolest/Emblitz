    "Welcome to Emblitz, a real-time online strategy game! Your objective is to take over the entire map and defeat all other players to win the round!",
    "The game is split into 2 phases: deploy and attack.",
    "The deploy phase is the first game phase and lasts 10 seconds. You'll be able to claim any unselected territory and change it if needed until the timer runs out. All players begin with 10 troops.",
    "The attack phase is the second game phase and lasts the rest of the round. You'll be able to attack other players' territory and move your own troops during this phase.",
    "Let's introduce the controls. On the bottom of the screen, there's a slider to control the amount of troops you want to send when attacking/moving. You can do this by dragging the slider around.",
    "The numbers beneath the slider show the percentage of troops you will be moving, as well as the actual amount of troops for the selected territory.",
    "Territories can be selected by simply tapping or clicking them. To deploy troops, simply do that to any unclaimed territory.",
    "To move or attack troops, first click on one of your own territories (same color as your avatar frame). You'll then see lines indicating your possible moves.",
    "Then, click on any highlighted territory that the lines point to to move troops there (if it's your own territory) or attack (if it's an enemy territory).",
    "On the top left of the screen, you'll see the troop addition timer. When this timer hits 0, all occupied territories will gain troops (excluding unclaimed ones)."
